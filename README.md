## Project task

This site is for a local apartment renting business. They wanted to present their apartments with images and Google Maps. Design is mostly the client's idea.

## Project overview

Presentation of their business through images and Google Maps. I used Google maps to show how accessible they are, and how close they are to the sea. Again, design is mostly the client's idea. The website is fully responsive.

## Built with
